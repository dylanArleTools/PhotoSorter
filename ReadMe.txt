This tool will copy .jpg photos from an Android phone to another storage location and sort them by date.

Specific dates (or date ranges) can be selected using the Calendar control before starting the copy to specify that photos from those dates should be further sorted into a day directory within the Month parent directory (default).

Clicking the Sort button starts the copy operation.

Any photos that already exist in the destination directory will be copied to a Duplicates directory for the user to review.

Following the copy, the Output label displays the total number of photos that were copied and the number of duplicates that were found.
